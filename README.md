# PWA Application: J A T E 

## Description
JATE is 'Just Another Text Editor' that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria that features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancies in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.
